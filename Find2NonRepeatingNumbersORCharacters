Given an array in which all numbers except two are repeated once. (i.e. we have 2n+2 numbers and n numbers
are occurring twice and remaining two have occurred once). Find those two numbers in the most efficient way.

                                                         OR
The above question can also be given for String, where we need to find any two characters which are non-repeating in the String.
