PLEASE READ THE CONTENT IN THE ABOVE LINK BEFORE SOLVING THE BELOW MENTIONED QUESTIONS:

ALWAYS REMEMBER NUMBERS ARE STORED IN REGISTERS IN PROGRAMMING

XOR Properties: (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or)
I. Commutative: YES (i.e.  a XOR b XOR c = b XOR a XOR c = c XOR a XOR b and all possible combinations are true for
any number of operands)
PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Because of this property, we could solve the "find missing number" problem mentioned below in point(3).
II. Associative: YES (i.e. a XOR (b XOR c) = (a XOR b) XOR c
